# blog-list-backend

This repo contains my solutions to the exercises in part 4 of the [Deep Dive Into Modern Web Development](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part4) course. The exercises in part 4 focus on testing a backend application with Jest, and then implementing user authentication and token based authorization.

The frontend repo of this application can be found [here](https://github.com/enrique-cardenas/blog-list-frontend).
This application also contains a "build:ui" script which creates a build version of the frontend in order to allow the backend application to be deployed to heroku.

To allow for the "build:ui" script to work, make sure the frontend repo folder and backend repo folder are in the same directory then in that directory open Terminal and run
```
npm run build:ui
```

A live demo hosted with Heroku can be found [here](https://arcane-tundra-01783.herokuapp.com/)
